/**
 * RemoteBridge — WS multiplexer for the mobile remote-control bridge (M0).
 *
 * Reuses the SAME per-run MessagePort broker shape as `main.ts`'s
 * `run-command` IPC handler (a fresh port pair per run; one half transferred
 * to the interpreter, the other kept here): a WS connection stands in for the
 * renderer's side of that port, relaying `InterpreterFrame`/`RendererControl`
 * over the single multiplexed socket instead of a dedicated MessagePort.
 * `create-session`/`destroy-session`/`list-sessions` are handled the same way
 * main.ts's IPC handlers do (session-created round-trip correlated by a
 * bridge-minted `requestId`, distinct from the client's own `requestId`).
 *
 * Everything Electron-specific (the real `WebSocketServer`, the interpreter
 * `UtilityProcess`, real `MessageChannelMain`s) is injected — this module
 * never imports `electron`, so the connection-handling logic (`attachConnection`)
 * is unit-testable with fake ports/interpreter/WS objects.
 *
 * Auth: the FIRST message on a new connection must be `{kind:'auth', token}`
 * matching the persisted token — anything else (wrong kind, wrong token)
 * closes the socket immediately (WS close code 4001) and no other message is
 * processed before auth succeeds.
 *
 * `startRemoteBridge` also runs a ws ping/pong heartbeat sweep so a
 * half-open phone socket (app backgrounded/killed without a clean close)
 * doesn't keep a `statsSource`/packet-mirror acquire alive forever.
